title: Annotations
+++

In LADoc, annotations explain what the following content is.
For example, at the very beginning of a main project file should be a project annotation.
Project annotations contain the name, package id, media directory, etc.

Here's an example of a project annotation.

```ladoc
\+++project
name: Ionic
package: com.ionic.framework
media: media
+++
```

As you can see, annotations are set aside by three pluses.
